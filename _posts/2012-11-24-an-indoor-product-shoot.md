To paraphrase, if you eat sausage, you don't want to see how it's made. In a similar vein, I thought I'd show you how a product shoot is staged, for better or worse. If you have a queasy stomach, look away.

For our revised website, which premiers in a couple of weeks, we needed to show potential clients how our Portfolio boxes look. Here is one of the results of that shoot.

Having been commissioned to produce 30 of these boxes for one client recently, we decided to set up shop in the upstairs of my home. We chose that spot because it is well lit and would not need extra light stands, flashes, diffusers and other paraphernalia of the product-shot trade. There are times when we have to resort to elaborate setups, but in this case we felt that we could get reasonable images without so much fuss. It was worth a try at least.

After umpteen trips upstairs with the goods, we finally dragged up the cameras and got to work. Normally we would lay out fancy materials or backdrops but, again, we wanted simplicity. We also knew that we would be shooting tight, making elaborate props unnecessary.

Bob took this shot of me at work with my Hasselblad H4D-50 and 50-110mm lens. Bob shot his images on his Fuji x100, hand-held (pretty impressive little camera... in the hands of a pro).

My point in sharing this with you is that with today's digital cameras, you really don't need a lot of other fancy stuff to get solid images that meet your needs. If you shoot in RAW, you can change the white balance to achieve the color balance you want, from cool to warm. You can crop, burn, dodge, globally adjust and fine tune. In fact, if there are indoor projects you've been wanting to do, winter is the perfect time to check them off your to-do list.
