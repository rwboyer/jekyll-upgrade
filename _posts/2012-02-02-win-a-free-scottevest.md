If you’re a photographer, listen up! Do I have a deal for you!!

To help celebrate Photographers’ Month at my favorite outdoor clothing website— <a href="http://www.scottevest.com">ScotteVest</a> — I’m giving away a brand new Classic ScotteVest to one of our blog visitors! Just be sure to enter <strong>by February 29</strong>. Winners will be announced on March 1.

<strong>UPDATE</strong>: The contest is ending soon, folks, so enter your best few images ASAP! There are two main prizes (and who knows what else might be in store for you brave entrants?).
<h3>The Classic ScotteVest</h3>
Why should you want to win this contest? Simply because, in my opinion (humble or otherwise), the Classic ScotteVest is… well, a classic. It has 22 pockets—  count ‘em— with features that never cease to amaze me. There are pockets for my iPhone, point-and-shoot camera, water bottle, sunglasses, pens and passport, even an iPad!

I’ve owned one of these puppies for years and it allows me to breeze through airport security. And here is a little secret; I get to shed about five pounds of technology from my suitcase so I don’t get charged $100 extra (round trip, of course… what a bargain!). The vest is so well balanced I hardly feel it and ScotteVest’s “No Bulge” system keeps everything out of site. Plus, I get to have all my essentials with me.

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
I make no bones about, I'm proud to be the ScotteVest photography columnist on their website. I make no money on anything sold by ScotteVest. I collaborate with them simply because I believe in their products and use their clothing every time I take a photo trip (actually, I also wear their Hoodie at home on chilly days). I was a customer of theirs long before I agreed to do a photography column for them. I do get to test out some of their gear. It’s not only some of the best made outdoor clothing I have ever used, but it’s THE most thoughtfully made. ‘Nuf said.
