Today Richard Hartmier and I left Eagle Plains for the drive back to Dawson City. It was another long day of driving and photographing, but it seems like every turn in the road brings another spectacular vista... even the road itself.

At the northern part of our drive the Fall red colors have begun to develop.

We stopped along the Ogilvie River for what was supposed to be a quick photo session.

But one of Richard's most trusted lenses developed a light leak, so we stayed for a while testing it to find out the cause.

Onward, and with the last light of day quickly disappearing behind ominous clouds, we stopped at a pond to take in the reflections in the surrounding mountains (remember to click on the images to enlarge them).

Within minutes of taking this image, the weather went south on us, as did we. We continued south to Dawson City under black clouds and rain, but we did see some gorgeous scenery and even had a chance to capture some "keepable" images.

Tomorrow we take off from Dawson to the Dempster to explore its lower section more. We're hoping for great weather to make up for yesterday. Remember that you can follow us live, nearly step by step, on <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0kZSlrkmUT5roDXDQ9VAGrsoTydOkgGEl">my SPOT site</a>. It's interactive, too. Just hit the buttons on the upper right of the page to switch from map view to terrain, to satellite.
