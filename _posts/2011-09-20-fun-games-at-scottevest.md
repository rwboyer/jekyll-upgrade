I just received word about an interesting contest from my colleague, Scott Jordan, the CEO of <a href="http://www.scottevest.com">ScotteVest</a>, an outdoor clothing company based in Colorado. If you are a regular reader of my blog you know that I am the photography columnist for the ScotteVest website (you can find my columns <a href="http://www.scottevest.com/company/photography.shtml">here</a>), although Iâ€™d been using their fine clothing long before I began writing/photography for them. I find their clothing line to be perfect for photographers, with scads of pockets to store virtually every gadget we typically use. In fact, in my recent blog on my <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/09/02/close-encounters-of-the-bear-kind/">bear encounter in the Yukon</a>, you can see that I was wearing my "uniform," a ScotteVest Fleece 5.0 jacket.

SeV is offering a $10,000 <em><strong>Trip of Your Life</strong></em> contest that will send the lucky winner on their dream vacation, all decked out in the latest, greatest SeV clothing, of course!

Full details can be found <a href="http://www.scottevest.com/contest">here</a>. If you are the creative sort, this contest sounds like lots of fun and just might be your cup of tea (in India or China, for example).
