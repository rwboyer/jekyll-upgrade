<h3>My Newest E-Book Is Here!</h3>
I’m really excited to announce that the newest eBook in <strong><em>The Photographer’s Eye</em></strong> series is now available. Titled <strong><em>Wildlife</em></strong>, the eBook takes you behind the scenes as I explain the how, why and technical challenges I faced for ten selected images I have taken of wildlife over the years.

Following on the heels of my first two eBooks, <strong><em>Landscapes 1 </em></strong>&amp;<strong><em> People</em></strong>, the newest addition describes in detail the process I went through to take images of wildlife that my editors and clients have loved. You’ll learn the dos and don’ts of great wildlife photography by following what I did right- and what went wrong- as I captured these images.

In <strong><em>Wildlife</em></strong> I’ve also intentionally broadened the definition of wildlife to include small, as well as large animals, and urban critters as well as those found in remote locales.

Each two-page spread includes an ultra high-quality 300dpi image and a page of background and explanation. Included with each image are the precise camera settings I used. Unlike other eBooks, all my eBook images are color managed for the absolutely highest quality possible.

As in all issues of my <strong><em>The Photographer’s Eye</em></strong> eBooks, <strong><em>Wildlife</em></strong> concludes with a section of detailed tips and suggestions. Titled “Photographing Wildlife: Ten Tips for Images With Impact,” you will get point-by-point recommendations for animal photographs that will add drama and punch to your images, recommendations that are gleaned from my forty years behind the camera.

Priced at just $4.99, each eBook can be kept on your iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad, laptop or other electronic device, so it’s always handy.
