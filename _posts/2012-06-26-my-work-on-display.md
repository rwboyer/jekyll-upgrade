On Friday, July 6, beginning at 6:00 PM, I will be the featured artist at La Banque de Fleuve in Havre de Grace, Maryland. This is part of Havre de Grace’s seasonal tradition of First Fridays which plays out from May through October in grand fashion along its downtown streets.

I love First Fridays. There is music (and dancing) in the street by many bands and solo performers, from jazz to rock to folk. There is scrumptious food to be sampled from street vendors and our terrific town restaurants. Street performers roam around providing entertainment for families. There is a vintage car show and crafts of all kinds. Most of all are the wonderful people you meet, coming from all over the region.

This is the very first time my work will be featured in La Banque, a unique and impressive event and meeting venue in the heart of downtown. La Banque, as its name implies, is a historic granite bank and the immense, walk-in vault is still on display and functions as a wine-tasting room.
