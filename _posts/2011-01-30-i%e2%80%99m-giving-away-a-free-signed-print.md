As I said in a recent blog (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/01/21/going-for-the-gold-yukon-gold/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/01/21/going-for-the-gold-yukon-gold/</a>), I’m thrilled to be returning to the Yukon for my fourth visit, but my first in the dead of winter.

<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Moraine-Lake1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-898" title="Moraine Lake" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Moraine-Lake1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a>

To celebrate my trip, I’m giving away a 12 x 18* signed print* to one <strong><em>registered</em></strong> user on my site. It can be any print on display at my image website: <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com">www.lesterpickerphoto.com</a>.

If you’re not currently registered for this blog site, just click on the registration box on my Home Page or the page you are now on or on any other registration box found on my website. It’s quick and easy and we <strong>never</strong> use your email address for spam, nor do we sell or trade your name and/or registration information.

There are several benefits to registering on my site. First, you’ll be notified of new blogs and news items appearing on the site. Second, we’ll tell you when new images are added to my images website (<a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com">www.lesterpickerphoto.com</a>). Third, you’ll be notified of sales and other discounts offered <strong>exclusively</strong> to registered users. Fourth, registered users are automatically entered to win my print giveaways whenever I travel to a new location. Fifth, and perhaps most importantly, you’ll be part of a vibrant community of people at all stages of photography.

To be eligible for this giveaway you have to agree to have your name posted on my site as the winner. I also hope you’ll agree to allow me to “interview” you, either by phone or by email, so I can post a quote or two on the blog. Maybe you’d be willing to post a photo of your winning photo once you get it framed and hung, but that’s up to you.

The drawing will be held on the evening of February 21, 2011, Eastern time and will be announced as soon as we're able to contact the winner.

That’s it. Please stay warm while I’m in the Yukon.

*<strong>Please note:</strong> some of my images come from my film days or are specially cropped, and so may not be able to be printed at exactly 12’ x 18”. We'll make it as close as we can.
