I was alone in the Canadian Rockies, spending two glorious weeks photographing in one of my favorite places on Earth. This particular day dawned overcast and bone-chilling cold, the perfect day for a landscape photographer! I drove in and around Kananaskis National Park and I stopped for an energy bar breakfast on the shores of Spray Lake. 

The clouds hung low and were moving fast, sure signs of an approaching storm. As I looked north down the lake, what caught my eye was the contrast between the crystal clear water, rocks and the impending storm. Yet, and here is where I was taken in, the sun was able to tinge the distant clouds with a touch of pink. 

I ran back to my car to retrieve my waders and kneeled in the water to get the rocks in the foreground the way I wanted.
