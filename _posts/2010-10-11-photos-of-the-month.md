I just uploaded a new Photos of the Month, this time featuring Animals. These are random images of animals taken in the past few years, from the Galapagos, the Yukon, and the Canadian Rockies.

Just click on "Photos of the Month" in the black banner section in the upper left of the Home page. Please leave your comments and feedback. Let me know what themes you'd like to see for next month.

Thanks for looking!
