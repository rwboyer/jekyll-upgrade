I’m very excited to announce that the newest eBook in my <strong><em>The Photographer’s Eye</em></strong> series is now available. Titled <strong><em><a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/102">People 1</a></em></strong>, the eBook takes you behind the scenes as I explain the how, why and technical challenges I faced for ten selected images I have taken of people over the years.

<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2007-Otaval.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1723" title="2007-Otaval" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2007-Otaval-300x205.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="205"></a>

Following on the heels of my first eBook, <strong><em><a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/101">Landscapes 1</a></em></strong>, the newest addition describes in detail the process I went through to take images of people that my editors and clients have loved. You’ll learn the dos and don’ts of great environmental and cultural portrait photography as I describe what I did right and what went wrong as I captured these images.

Each two-page spread includes an ultra high-quality 300dpi image and a page of background and explanation. Included with each image are the precise camera settings I used. Unlike other eBooks, all my eBook images are color managed for the absolutely highest quality possible.

As in all issues of my <strong><em>The Photographer’s Eye</em></strong> eBooks, <strong><em><a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/102">People 1</a></em></strong> ends with a section of detailed tips and suggestions. Titled “Photographing People: Ten Tips for Images With Impact,” you will get point-by-point recommendations for people photographs that will add drama and punch to your images, recommendations that are gleaned from my forty years behind the camera.

Priced at just $4.99, each eBook can be kept on your iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad, laptop or other electronic device, so it’s always handy.

Try one by clicking <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/">here</a> and you’ll be taken to a descriptive page where you’ll be able to place your order. Once again, I warn you. These eBooks are addictive!

And by the way, I always welcome your comments and feedback.
