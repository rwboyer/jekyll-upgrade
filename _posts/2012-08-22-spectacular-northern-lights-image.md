Damn that <a href="http://www.hartmier.com">Richard Hartmier</a>! Those of you who read my blog know how much I like and admire Richard, a friend and very capable pro photographer from the Yukon (you've got to be capable to make a living as a photographer in the Yukon). But, damn him all the same!
Richard managed to capture this incredible Northern Lights image just a few miles from his home in Whitehorse. Folks, this is only mid-August and it's rare to get Northern Lights this early. But the lights are at an 11-year peak from now through 2013, which is why Richard and I are heading to Iceland together in September, 2013 to get some Fall images there, along with, hopefully, the Northern Lights. I thought I'd share Richard's incredible image with you. It was taken next to Schwatka Lake on the outskirts of Whitehorse, the capital of Yukon Territory.

For now at least, Richard has the upper hand in our friendly rivalry. Damn him!
