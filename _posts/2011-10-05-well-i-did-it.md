After a year of researching, testing, talking to colleagues and trying out various cameras, I finally made the plunge. Just last week I purchased a digital medium format system, after researching both the brand new Pentax 645D and the relatively new Hasselblad H4D system. The hammer came down on the Hasselblad (oh, God, please not literally!!).

If you’re a regular reader of my blog you know that I tried a large format (LF) system for nearly a year. I finally decided it was too cumbersome for my needs, of which mobility is paramount. I am fortunate to get to travel to iconic locations, but that often involves strenuous hiking or situations where I have to limit my luggage. My wonderful Arca Swiss LF system with many lenses is now up for sale (interested?).

So, after going back to the drawing board, I realized that a medium format (MF) system was my next option. My present Nikon cameras shoot at 12 megapixels to as high as 25. My Hasselblad H4D-50 creates digital files that are 50MP! My clients are increasingly requesting very large images to hang on the walls of hospitals, offices and private homes and these large MF files will allow us to create very large prints, indeed.

So far I’ve had the camera and lenses for only a few days, but from what I see so far, I’m thrilled. You may also know that I’m still recovering from hand surgery, so my assistant, Bob, has had to hoist the hefty Hasselblad onto the tripod for me so I can start getting used to it. I’m looking forward to exploring its capabilities.

Over the next few weeks I’ll be reporting on my experience with the Hasselblad. So, if you’re interested in this aspect of photography, stay tuned. In the meantime, happy shooting!
