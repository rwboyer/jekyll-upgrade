Just got back from a wonderful fiction writer's conference in San Diego (more on that in a later blog). Getting there and back necessitated 4 flights segments, so I had to listen to the "fasten your seatbelt" instruction 4 times.

The thought occurs to me: Is there a moron anywhere in the world who doesn't know how to buckle a seatbelt?? Do we really still need flight attendants worldwide instructing us on how to fasten a seat belt? Does anyone have any idea of how much time is wasted every day on this inane instruction?

The way I figure it, anyone who doesn't know how to buckle a seatbelt should be removed from the gene pool anyway! Then again, seatbelt or not, what are your chances of making it out alive from a plane crash?

I think that anyone over age 5 should have to pass a seat belt buckling proficiency test before boarding. If you flunk, you are sent down to the rental car counter where- does this makes any sense?- you can rent a car without any seatbelt instruction whatsoever, even though seat belts are well proven to save lives in the event of a car crash. Go figure!
