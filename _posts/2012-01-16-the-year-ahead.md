2011 was a pretty good year… photographically, that is. I was able to fulfill a decades-old desire and delve deep into large format photography, only to find that it does not suit my travel style. Bummer. But I had fun finally tackling that beast and putting it to rest.

It was also the year that I added medium format to my repertoire, and I am enjoying my Hasselblad H4D-50 very, very much. With its 50-megapixel files and extraordinary sensor, I get luscious, film-like images that exceed my expectations.

I was also able to travel to some wonderful places for photography this past year- including Canada’s Yukon Territory, Alaska, Zion National Park and New Mexico. I was able to write about these travels and illustrate them with my images both <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/category/travelogue/">here</a> and for a wide range of commercial newspapers and magazines.

And, as it has been for the past three years, I have enjoyed my interactions with my associate, Bob Boyer, who is truly a very talented guy. He is constantly challenging me on a profession level and making things happen for our business.
<h3>Onward to 2012!</h3>
I look forward to 2012 with excitement and a sense of humility. For one thing, my travels will range far and wide, from U.S. locations to Finland (not finalized yet), Israel, Sri Lanka, Iceland, Norway (also not yet finalized), and Maine. Sadly, a planned photo shoot in Africa in January did not pan out due to unrest in Kenya.

I’m also looking forward to more fully incorporating my <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/11/29/review-of-the-hasselblad-h4d-50/">Hasselblad equipment</a> into my workflow. My <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/07/23/canadian-rockies-deciding-what-photo-equipment-to-take/">Nikon system</a>, which I have been using since 1970, is second nature to me and it’s a blessing when your equipment does not get in the way of your creative vision.

This year we will be upgrading my gallery website and adding very exciting new products, so stay tuned.

I have a <a href="http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/all/viewWorkshop.html?workshop_id=107">terrific photography workshop</a> scheduled for October in Maine’s Acadia National Park under the auspices of Nikonians, where I am a member of their Academy faculty. This 4-day event promises to be full of spectacular fall photo opps in my very favorite National Park.

However, what I’m most excited about for 2012 is having been chosen the creative artist for a major teaching hospital’s newest wing. Opening in September, this will mean choosing, post-processing and mounting nearly 100 of my images, most of them at 36 x 30 and some much larger. One image, in particular, will run 28 feet in length!

What gives me the most pleasure with this project is working with some of the finest hospital construction experts and interior designers I have ever met, along with some very dedicated and compassionate health care workers. Each image must be chosen with care, since this unit is dedicated to traumatic brain injury patients and their families. It’s a challenge that I relish. Of course, I’ll keep you posted as the project progresses.

I spent the time between Christmas and New Year writing down my photography (and business) goals for the year. The question I have for you is: What are your photographic goals? Are you bold enough to share them with us here?
