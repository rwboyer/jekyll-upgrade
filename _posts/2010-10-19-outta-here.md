We’re ready to leave and I’ve already given instructions to our house sitter… multiple times (I’m beginning to envy his carefree life over the course of our trip).

It’s T-minus-2 days. The Australia and Fiji segments are wrapped up, leaving just a few loose ends on our New Zealand adventure. I’m determined to allow that part of the trip to stay loose, in order to take advantage of the photo ops that present themselves.

Right now I’m doing my photo organizing and cleaning. I like to start a trip with clean equipment, so I can amass a rich and diverse collection of dust spots on my sensor as I travel. I mean, what else would I do with my time at night in my hotel room when I’m dead tired other than clean my equipment in dim lighting?

Since this trip is so long and will involve hiking to some remote locations, I have to limit my equipment. You can see from the photo some of what I’ve decided to take along. Most of that equipment will have to fit tightly into my ThinkTank photo backpack (see my previous blog on the backpack I’ll be taking: <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2009/05/25/transporting-your-gear/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2009/05/25/transporting-your-gear/</a>).

I’ll probably blog next from Vancouver airport (free Wifi!!), showing my tidy backpack, assuming TSA or the airline hasn’t confiscated it by then.

Have a wonderful few weeks, everyone, and don’t forget to follow my blogs from Down Under, ask questions, give advice, state opinions… whatever. I'll also be providing mini-reviews of sites, events, hotels and restaurants, so be prepared to save the blogs if a trip Down Under is on your bucket list.

Best Wishes,
