In honor of spring, when you will undoubtedly be out there trying to make up for lost camera time, here is another tip, a simple but critical one, taken from one of my <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/">The Photographer's Eye</a> e-books. This one is from my <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/103">photographing wildlife e-book</a>.

The most critical aspect of photographing wildlife is that you have the eyes in focus.  The fact is that an animal shot can be mediocre, but if the eyes are sharp, chances are people will probably like it. If the eyes are out of focus, no amount of composition or drama will help. This is especially important when shooting tight head shots with a telephoto lens. Always stay focused on the eyes.
