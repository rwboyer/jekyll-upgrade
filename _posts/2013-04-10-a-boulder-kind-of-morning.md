I was preparing to leave for Denver airport from Boulder, en route back home. I was pretty much packed, when I decided to give myself one last photo treat. An unusual blizzard had dumped 8-10 inches of snow along a wide swath of Colorado, but the morning dawned bright and beautiful. What's a camera jockey to do?

I hurriedly grabbed my Nikon D800, my 70-200 lens and my Gitzo 3541 with RRS BH-55 ballhead and dashed out the door. I drove to Chataqua Park at the base of the foothills and did some quick pano work of the iconic Flatirons, bathed in snow and sunshine.

These were five vertical images, shot from a level tripod. I did not have time to put on my RRS parallax adjustment jig, nor even a polarizer. Just a few sets of click-click-click-click-click and I was out of there.

I pieced the image together in PTGUI, did a tonal curve sitting here at the airport and here we are. Nothing fancy, but nice use of what might otherwise have been a wasted morning.
