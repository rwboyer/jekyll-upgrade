During my stay here in Finland, the weather has been, shall I say, uncooperative... photographically, that is. The skiers are in heaven, since a lot of snow has fallen. However, for me the weather has been mostly overcast and snowy, limiting my photographic possibilities.

I've only had two days of decent or partially decent weather, but oh, were they grand! One evening the skies put on a show-of-shows. Right before dinner, starting at around 5:30 PM, a colleague and I rushed outside as the Aurora Borealis began to form. Here is a an image I took at dusk.

Now I don't know how many of you have experienced The Lights, but all I can say is that there is no other such experience on earth. It is awesome and humbling at the same time. The first time I witnessed them, in Dawson City, Yukon Territory, I wept. They are that incredible.

But every time I have been privileged to see them since, I feel the same degree of awe. They are science's portal to the spiritual. I can see how indigenous cultures deified this phenomenon.

Anyway, back to Kittila, Finland, where these images were taken. As I stood on the banks of the Muonio River that separates Finland from Sweden, the skies quickly darkened and the lights came out in full glory. Here is another image, taken from the identical spot on the property of the Harriniva Hotel, just 30 minutes later.

I promised more information on my images this year and in this case the best way I know how to provide that is to refer you to a <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/15/how-to-photograph-the-northern-lights/">previous blog I wrote</a> on taking Aurora images.

In eight days I only had one night of good aurora photography, and then it only lasted about 90 minutes, before it became overcast again. Still, how can anyone complain? I'd easily wait a week again for an hour's worth of pure magic.
