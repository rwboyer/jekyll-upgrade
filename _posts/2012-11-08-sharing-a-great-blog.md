It's rarely that I come across a truly wonderful blog, one I cannot wait to share. But just yesterday my colleague Dan Stainer, an advanced amateur who could go pro whenever he wanted, sent me a link to his latest blog and I was impressed. Again.

In the way of background, Dan was honored by being selected for the Missouri Photography Workshop, where a group of skilled craftspeople share a week under the tutelage of some of the best photographers in the country. Each has to complete a photojournalism story while having their work critiqued at every twist and turn. Talking about pressure!

Dan did a credible job during his stay. But what I think makes his blog so good is its humanity. Dan shares with us his fears and self-doubt, the same ones we all face when we embark on a new assignment. I don't want to give away too much. I urge you to <a href="http://danielstainer.wordpress.com/2012/11/03/missouri-photo-workshop-an-experience-that-lasts-a-lifetime/">visit his post</a> and enjoy it.
