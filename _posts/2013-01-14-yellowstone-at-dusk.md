Well, we arrived in Yellowstone National Park around 3:30 PM, far too late to photograph anything. My friend, Sherif Osman, and I took a quick jaunt through the park just to get our bearings. It was a foggy, cold, windy day, with temperatures around zero Fahrenheit. The sun had already set behind the mountains, but there was enough diffuse light for some amazing sightings. In just over an hour we saw mule deer, elk, and bison. As we rounded a bend on the park road, we saw some slow moving traffic coming our way. I thought I'd share that tiny <a href="http://youtu.be/MsbIXWhA3Xc">20-second iPhone video</a> with you. Man, those animals are big!

Stay tuned for more, as tomorrow we begin our photo safari.
