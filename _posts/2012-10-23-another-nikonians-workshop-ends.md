It's the end of another spectacular Fall Maine Nikonians workshop. Frankly, I'm sorry to see it end. Coastal Maine in the Fall is a joy that every landscape and travel photographer should experience. There are, of course, the quintessential rocky coast images to be captured, but there are also the birch forests, tree-lined ponds, bogs, waterfalls, lighthouses, and thick-cushioned, undulating moss that fluoresces in the rain or fog. There are quiet, picturesque villages like Somesville, and hard working lobstermen and women in their colorful boats in towns like Southwest Harbor, Bass Harbor or Bernard.

I've often said that Mt. Desert Island, where the epicenter of Acadia National Park is located, has more photo opps per square meter than any other place on earth. Drop a pin anywhere in Acadia and if you can't spend the rest of the day photographing within 100 yards of that pin, call your optometrist.

This year's workshop was fully subscribed, although a few days before we began one of the participants had to drop out due to a family emergency. I like to limit my workshops to ten or fewer people, depending on the location, so each participant can feel comfortable asking me for help or advice.

This year our group gelled from the moment we met. Coming from as far away as Texas, we shared, critiqued, laughed and shot sunrises, sunsets and all sorts of scenics in between. We even elected to have dinner together each night, sharing our daily adventures over good food, micro-brew beers and good wines.

When all is said and done I want to tip my hat to my workshoppers. Not only did I enjoy their company, but I learned some things myself. I was so impressed by the positive attitude, the collegiality, and the dedication these folks exhibited to their avocation. They are a passionate group, eager to learn and use new skills to improve their self-expression through photography. I made nine wonderful friends over the past four days. Hats off to you fine folks!

Next year's workshops in Acadia will be posted soon on the <a href="http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/all/viewWorkshop.html?workshop_id=107">Nikonians website</a>. Check there for details.
