Here's another photo tip from my eBook <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/">Photographing People</a> in my <em><strong>The Photographer's Eye</strong></em> series. I call it: <strong>Get a Picture, Give a Print</strong>.

This is always a fun thing to do, if you intend to visit a location again, OR if you use one of the tiny new portable printers now on the market.

<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2006-11-ecuador17461.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2729" title="Winning Smile" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2006-11-ecuador17461-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a>

 

Once you get a subject to agree to allow you to take their picture- and often I end up making some great friends that way- I either send a print to that person once I get home or else bring one with me on my next visit to the country. In Ecuador, there is a market in Otavalo where I love to spend time photographing. When I go back, I bring prints of my subjects from my last visit and now the people are excited when I return. They even have my prints hanging on their walls.

This is a great way to make friends, influence people, and make the job easier for you on subsequent visits or for fellow photographers. I personally do not tip people for taking their photos, but I do show my gratitude by sending them something that I consider even more valuable. That respect goes a long way.
