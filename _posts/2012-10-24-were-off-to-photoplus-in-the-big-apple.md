Bob and I are off to the <a href="http://www.photoplusexpo.com">PhotoPlus</a> Expo in New York City. PhotoPlus is the largest photo convention in the country, drawing tens of thousands of avid photographers. The convention hall is filled with amateurs and pros checking out the hundreds of exhibitors and brushing up on new products and techniques.

There are demonstrations, lectures, one-on-one consultations and critiques. The atmosphere is fairly electric. Even if you spent every moment of the three days exploring the vendors, you'd be hard pressed to cover them all. Cameras, lenses, printers, gadget bags, lighting products, and photo papers.

The latter is what is drawing us this year. Partnering with <a href="http://www.museofineart.com">Museo Digital Fine Art Media</a>, a division of Intelicoat Technologies, our photographic artwork is being featured in their exhibit. Bob is the Master Printer who brings my landscapes, wildlife and custom photography to life. We printed a series of my images on Museo's Silver Rag and Max paper for their New York exhibit. During the Expo I'll be photographing with my iPhone and posting updates on new equipment, techniques, and interesting people.

The interesting thing about our association with Museo is that we have always loved their papers. They are luscious, gorgeous, consistent- whatever adjective you'd want to associate with the best fine art photo papers. And their D-Max is unbeatable. If you are planning to attend PhotoPlus, please stop by Museo's booth to learn about their products and say hi.
