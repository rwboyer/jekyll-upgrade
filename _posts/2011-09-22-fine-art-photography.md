Perhaps you’ve noticed in the past several days that we have changed the look of my blog a bit. For one thing the color scheme is slightly different. But the larger change is in our logo, which is now Les Picker Fine Art Photography (a big thanks to my able assistant, Bob Boyer, who designed the new logo).

<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/logo.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1608" title="logo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/logo.png" alt="" width="177" height="39"></a>

The reason for the change is far more than marketing, and its implications run deep for me (and, as you will see, will be costly, too). My clients, from individuals to hospitals and offices, are using my images as wall art. At the same time, our very discriminating clients are looking for large images that make a statement. They choose my work for many reasons, some of which I’ll probably never know. But many tell me it is for the serenity they get from my naturescapes, the dynamic visual statement they make, or perhaps just the splashes of color or the emotional depth of a classic black and white print.

The decision to change our logo to be in sync with our evolving business was not made casually. We debated this for months. In the end, we decided to also pony up to the bar and upgrade our equipment to meet these marketplace demands.

Earlier this year I attempted to get into large format view camera photography since the huge film sheets allow for big enlargements. After eight months of effort, I decided to abandon large format because it did not suit my work style, which involves lots of fieldwork, flying and hiking to remote places; a shame really, because I love large format film images.

Now I’m actively researching and trying out various medium format (MF) camera system alternatives. This should give me a large enough digital image and pixel count to create very large prints that will meet my exacting demands. I’m currently focusing (excuse the pun) on the new Hasselblad H4D line (between 30 and 200 megapixels!) and the brand-spanking new Pentax 645D (weighing in at a respectable 40 MP). Compare that with 12 MP or 24MP for the best Nikon cameras currently on the market. Unfortunately, these medium format cameras also cost a bundle.

Don’t get me wrong. I love my Nikon equipment and will continue to rely on it for wildlife imagery and some landscapes. But the MF sensors are considerably larger and will offer me several advantages which I’ll get into in depth in future blogs.

I’m having some hand surgery this week for a bad thumb joint. But as soon as that heals I’ll be taking out these cameras for a field test. I’ll keep you informed as I go through the selection process. Hasselblad has been kind enough to offer me a camera to test at the beginning of November. If any of you have experience with these Hasselblad or Pentax cameras, please let me know.
