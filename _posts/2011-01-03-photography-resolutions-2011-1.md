Trumpets, please! Now some fanfare…. and roll the drums. It’s my annual New Year’s Photo Resolutions, Version 2011.1 (meaning they will undoubtedly change as the year progresses). Here are my major goals.
<h3>A Stitch In Time</h3>
This year I plan to get into panoramas, which some of my clients are demanding. I already have a terrific tripod (Gitzo 3541) and ball head (Really Right Stuff BH-55), so with that solid base I’m going to add panoramas to my repertoire.

That means I will have to find, learn and then use a stitching program for panoramas. That also means I’ll have to actually shoot some panoramas. Not sure whether or not I’ll need a nodal attachment for my ball head, but I’d welcome your opinions on this. What stitching software do you use? Do you find you need a special nodal adapter to get professional looking results?
<h3>Macro Managing</h3>
This year I’d finally like to do more macro photography, something I really enjoy but just can’t seem to get around to doing very much. I travel a lot on assignment and it’s impossible for me to shlep a macro lens and macro attachments for my tripod, along with an appropriate lighting setup. I find I need a dedicated photo trip with just macro in mind and that’s difficult to carve out of my day. But, this year…
<h3>Stage a Gallery Show</h3>
If you know of a good, tasteful art gallery that welcomes nature/landscape photography exhibitions, please let me know. I’m in the market for a major show.
<h3>Buy a D3x (or other 20+ megapixel Nikon camera)</h3>
I need a big megapixel count since I make very large prints. I’ve waited long enough. Nikon graciously sent me a D3x to test. I liked it… a lot, but not enough to shell out $7,500 for a heavy monster with quirks. I may buy one when the price drops, or continue to wait until spring to see what new releases Nikon has in store for 2011.

<h3>Complete an e-Book</h3>
I’m working hard on developing an exciting e-Book for photographers. Once I get some shots that I need, I’ll go into the final stretch. My goal is to have it ready in May. We’ll see.

Now, what are <strong><em>your</em></strong> photo goals for 2011? Willing to share?
