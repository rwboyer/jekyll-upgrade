Not too many places on this planet can surpass the Canadian Rockies for a wildlife or landscape photographer. Majestic mountains, pristine lakes, moss-lined brooks, bear, moose, wolvesâ€¦ 

I love the Rockies the most at sunrise, when I can witness the natural world coming alive. I arrive, headlamp leading me to the spot I have usually cased out the day before. I set up as the sun begins to announce its presence by lighting the sky just a tad. All is still, birds nervously await the sun's warm rays and then, miraculously, the sun crests a nearby mountain and sprays of alpenglow ignite the peaks. The still waters reflect the mountains and meadows and sky. 

All is well. It is the start of another Fall day on Rampart Pond.
