I continue to test out my Hasselblad H4D-50 as I prepare for a major installation of my work in a Baltimore teaching hospital. Part of that installation will involve taking images of iconic Baltimore scenes, a process that Bob (my associate) and I have already begun. Whenever the weather is nice we run down to Baltimore and grab some shots, each time hopefully ticking off another site from our lengthy list.

Here are a few images taken with the Hassy, along with some background info for those of you who might be interested. The images have not been seriously post-processed, but they have been tweaked as part of our experimentation. All images were taken tripod-mounted.

This image of the iconic Domino Sugars sign in Baltimore's Inner Harbor was taken at twilight. ISO 200, f8, 1/8 sec, 50-110 lens @ 110mm. No post-processing used.

Another shot of the sign and factory after dark. ISO 200, f5.6, .3 sec, 50-110 lens @ 70mm. No post-processing with exception of neon sign itself, which Bob had to restore to its original color &amp; illumination in PhotoShop.

This shot of The Peabody Institute's library (part of The Johns Hopkins University) was taken with existing light only. The Peabody library is one of my favorite locations in Baltimore. Due to its Harry Potter-esque imagery, I tweaked it a bit with tonal adjustment in Nik software. ISO 100, f32, 32 sec, 28mm. I cannot believe that the people in the image stood/sat in one place long enough to register on the image!

This shot was also taken with existing light only. I shot this with my Hassy 28mm lens, which is the 35mm equivalent of 22mm (wow, that does sound confusing; I'll explain it in a future blog). I did not use my tilt-shift mechanism, which explains the walls leaning backwards. I plan to reshoot it next week. Still, I kind of like the image. What do you think?

Again, I tweaked this with tonal adjustments in Nik software. ISO 200, f11, 1 sec, 28mm lens. I shot at ISO 200 so I'd have a chance at capturing the students studying in the cubicles.
