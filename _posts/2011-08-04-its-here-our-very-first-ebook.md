After months of behind-the-scenes development work, I'm proud to announce the launch of my first photography eBook.

In <em><strong><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/ebook/">The Photographer’s Eye: Landscapes 1</a></strong></em>, I'll take you behind the scenes where I showcase some of my techniques and the thinking that goes into professional compositions. You will gain insights into the photographic process as I explain how each of ten, specially chosen stunning images was made, what I had to overcome to get the shot and how I tackled familiar and unique lighting challenges to bring home these highly praised photos.

Chock full of what I hope are helpful insights and recommendations, the e-Book also includes an interactive section where I give readers ten useful tips for creating evocative landscape images. Called “Ten Tips For More Dramatic Landscapes,” I'll share with you tips and suggestions gained from more than 40 years of successful photography.
