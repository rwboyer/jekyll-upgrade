<!--StartFragment-->It’s probably the oldest truism in photography. “If I only had THAT piece of equipment- that newest pro digital camera, that newest $6,000 lens, that newest gizmo- then I could take pictures like that!” Sigh. How many times have you heard that during your lifetime? Oh, what’s that? You haven’t actually said that yourself, have you?

Well, if I had a dollar for every time I’ve heard that said to me, I’d be able to open my own (part-time) bar in Tahiti and not have to work at making photographs. We’ve all heard the other truism, that it is not the equipment but the photographic eye that makes the difference between an award-winning image and a humdrum one. I agree. But, there’s more.

Go ahead and buy that overpriced new lens or camera if you can afford it, I’ll often say. Sure, it might give you better, crisper images. Might, not will. The fact is that these new toys are not only expensive, but they’re bulky and heavy.

I was reminded of this on my recent photo excursion to New Mexico, where I lugged a 4x5 film view camera, heavy tripod and my Nikon D700 35mm camera with me, plus four lenses. By now, of course, I’m used to loads like that, weighing in at anywhere from 25 to 40 pounds, depending on my assignment.

And that’s the point of this blog. Watch what you wish for! If you’re generally happy with that point-and-shoot or that small DSLR with a couple of lenses, P-L-E-A-S-E consider yourself very, very fortunate. My wife, with her Canon G12 point-and-shoot, sometimes captures great images before I even set up my damned gear. Do you really want to be lugging your closet around with you, up and down trails, on ledges, near ocean surf? Master the camera you have and nail down the art of composition. Join an online forum and ask for feedback. Ask questions right here. Practice… a lot. When you have reached the limits of your camera, only then consider that latest gizmo.

Happy shooting!
