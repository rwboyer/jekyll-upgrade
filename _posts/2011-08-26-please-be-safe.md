Here’s wishing all of my readers on the East coast of the U.S. the very best of luck in riding out this raging storm. May Hurricane Irene quickly become a thing of the past.

If any of you can <strong><em>safely</em></strong> get some images of the storm in your area, please feel free to upload them to this blog entry and explain to us what we are witnessing through your lens.

Stay safe, folks. I’ll be rooting for you from rainy Haines, Alaska.
