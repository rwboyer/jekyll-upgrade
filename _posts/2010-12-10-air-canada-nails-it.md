Folks, I've been saying it for years and now it's official:

<strong>AIR CANADA VOTED TOP HONOURS BY READERS OF BUSINESS TRAVELER MAGAZINE</strong>
<div id="content">
<ul>
<li><strong>Best Flight Attendants in North America</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Best In-Flight Services in North America</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Best North American Airline for Business Class Service</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Best North American Airline for International Travel </strong></li>
	<li>
<strong>Best Airline Web Sit</strong><strong>e</strong>
</li>
</ul>
I'm not professing to know about business travel, since I fly cattle-car within North American destinations. But I have been saying in my blogs that even in Economy, it's hard to beat Air Canada.

One of my favorite features is that there is a 120-volt outlet at every seat, as well as a USB port and terrific touch-screen entertainment system. Plug in, stick in your earbuds, turn on the music (or movie) Â and you can either relax or get substantial work done with no hassles. They also really, truly have flight attendants who are attendant!

Anyway, congrats Air Canada on a recognition that is well deserved.
