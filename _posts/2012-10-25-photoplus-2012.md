I'm here at PhotoPlus 2012 with Bob Boyer, my assistant, and so far we're enjoying the immersion in all things photographic. The Javits Center in mid-town Manhattan is gigantic and it is currently filled with tens of thousands of photo enthusiasts from all over the country, weaving their way through the overwhelming maze of exhibitors.

Today I spent most of my time talking with people who visited the Intelicoat Technologies, Inc. booth. I was one of the guest artists for their Museo Fine Art papers exhibit on the main floor of the gargantuan exhibition hall.

As I've said before, my assistant and Master Printer Bob Boyer and I simply love the luscious Museo papers. They have become the mainstay of our Limited Edition collections. We depend on their consistency, incredible D-MAX performance and tonal range to produce our large and small format prints.

Tomorrow I'll share with you some of the neat photo gadgets, gizmos and geeky gifts I saw at PhotoPlus. Please visit my blog then and you'll be set for Christmas and Hanukkah.

 

P)LEASE NOTE: Sorry folks, but I arrived home to preparations for Hurricane Sandy. We live on the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and we may have to evacuate, so stay tuned for details on PhotoPlus (and how we weathered the hurricane).
