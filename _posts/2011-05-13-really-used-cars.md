I’m not sure what it is with old, junk cars. As photographers we seem to be drawn to them like flies to…

Okay, let’s start again. I spend a good amount of time in the woods and fields taking photographs and every so often I come across a great old junk car, peacefully rusting away. It’s irresistible. Snap, snap, hmmmn, maybe that angle or this one. Is it a metaphor for our own creaking, degenerating bodies? Is it the triumph of nature over machine? If you actually take the time to sit down and think about it, how on earth can a rusting hunk of junk hold attraction for anyone, let alone a nature/landscape/wildlife photographer?

Here’s a bunch that I’ve taken over the years. Maybe you can explain to me what the attraction is.

This last one really gets me. It's an old joke to the natives of Maui, Hawaii. No one has ever been able to explain how this car got to the edge of this cliff. It would have had to drive over impossibly rough terrain and across small ravines to get there. Go figure!
