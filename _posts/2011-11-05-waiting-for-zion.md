What a bummer! Instead of leaving for Zion National Park for a glorious week of photography, I'm on the couch, alternating between a heating pad and ice packs, along with doses of muscle relaxants and pain killers. Yesterday evening I pulled my back out, but thought it was minor. When I woke up, ready to go to the airport, I couldn't even walk. My back had spasmed and I was in pretty extreme pain.

Tonight I feel considerably better, so I'm in hopes that I'll just be delayed a couple of days and will be able to join my buddy, Dan Stainer, by Tuesday. I've been looking forward to this trip and the chance to truly field test my Hasselblad system. But that entails me carting around a 30-lb backpack, so I guess I'll just have to heal first.
