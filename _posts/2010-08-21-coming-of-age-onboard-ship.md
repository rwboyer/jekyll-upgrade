We’re sitting on the aft deck of the Northern Expedition, a BC Ferry en route from Prince Rupert to Port Hardy, British Columbia, Canada, when I notice my granddaughter, bless her 16-year old heart, staring at my hands, which were at that moment, clutching my camera and a telephoto lens.

“Pop-pop,” she says, perfectly seriously. “I think you should be a hand model for AARP.” Then she bursts out laughing.

So, my question for you, dear reader’s, is this: Is she right? (Please be kind!)
