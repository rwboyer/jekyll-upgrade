To all of you who submitted images to the ScotteVest contest, I apologize for taking so long to connect you to their site for the announcement of winners. I have been out of the country (Israel) and now leave in a day for Sri Lanka for 3 weeks. For good measure, I got sick in Israel and am still fighting a nasty cold and cough

In any event, here is the link to the ScotteVest winners:

When you get to the link, you'll see our reasons for selecting the winners. Please understand that these types of contests are entirely subjective. I wish ScotteVest had set up several different categories so that we could have named more winners and perhaps next year they will. There were many terrific images submitted.

On behalf of ScotteVest, thanks to all of you who participated in the contest.
