In today's volatile financial market, how about an investment that pays out dividends every single day, will last for generations, and can earn profits when sold? If that appeals to you, then consider investing in Les' *[Limited Edition Prints](http://fineart.lesterpickerphoto.com/limited-edition-prints-d1.html)*.

Our *Limited Edition Prints* are hand-printed in our studio by Les and Master Printer Bob Boyer. We print on the finest, museum-quality papers, using the finest printers and inks. Our prints are guaranteed to last at least 100 years when framed behind UV glass. *Limited Edition Prints* are truly that. We limit print runs to either 10 or 25. 

Les typically spends days at a time and several visits to a location to capture his landscape, nature and wildlife images. For more information on our *Limited Edition Prints*, please click [here](/limited-edition/).
