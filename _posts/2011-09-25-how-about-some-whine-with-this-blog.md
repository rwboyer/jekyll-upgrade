As you can see, I had a bit of surgery two days ago.

This is the second time I had to undergo this repair of the arthritic base of my left thumb. The first time, about 5 years ago, the repair did not work and it's been getting steadily more painful as I balance my camera in my left hand. So I felt I had little choice. So I'm typing this with one finger, just to let you know that my communications this week will be a bit sparse.

I'll have this cast and wrap on for 10 days, then move to a light-weight cast for another month. The first week in November I'm heading to Zion National Park with my photo buddy <a href="http://www.danielstainer.com">Daniel Stainer</a>, so it's either got to be ready by then or else Daniel will have to put up with some good whine the whole trip. Sorry, Daniel!
