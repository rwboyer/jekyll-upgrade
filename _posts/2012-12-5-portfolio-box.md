We are proud to announce the availability of our first *Portfolio Edition* for discriminating photography fine art collectors. Our *Portfolio Editions* contain 10 or 12 museum-quality, hand-printed images, crafted in-house by Les and Master Printer Bob Boyer. 

Les decided to feature his work from Canada in this first *Portfolio Edition*. Les won the prestigious Canada Northern Lights Award for Best Travel Photography in 2012. 

One of the distinguishing features of our *Portfolio Editions* is the hand-made, cloth covered box that houses the images, in effect extending the artfulness of the presentation to your bookshelf or coffee table.
