A friend, Morgan Melekos, just sent me this image he took while I was photographing a Vermont stream scene. It was around 1 degree Fahrenheit that day. Although I sometimes have to get into a stream to photograph, I don't do so lightly. I advise my readers to always take proper precautions (see the ScotteVest column I did entitled "Don't Take The Plunge!": <a href="http://www.scottevest.com/company/photography.shtml">http://www.scottevest.com/company/photography.shtml</a>).

If you are curious, the camera is a Hasselblad H4D-50 with a 28mm lens and a Hasselblad tilt-shift mechanism between the lens and camera. Clothing includes my ScotteVest hoodie sweatshirt (and two layers underneath). My waders are from Orvis (I use soft-soled waders so I can feel the rocks, which I believe helps me from slipping). My tripod is a Gitzo 3541 with a Really Right Stuff BH-55 ballhead.
