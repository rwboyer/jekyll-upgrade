We are excited to announce that the first in our series of *Folio Collections* is now available. We designed our *Folio Collections* to appeal to individuals wanting to enter the photography fine art collectible market without significant financial exposure.                               

Our *Folio Collections* contain eight museum-quality, hand-printed images, crafted in-house by Les and Master Printer Bob Boyer. 

Les decided to feature his work from Canada in this first *Folio Collection*. Les won the prestigious Canada Northern Lights Award for Best Travel Photography in 2012. 

*Folio Collections* are housed in a card stock folio wrap to ensure that the images are protected and will last many generations.
