Thought you might be interested in the newest addition to my workflow.

After 18 months of treatment for what we thought was simply plantar fasciitis turned out to actually be a fractured heel. It's hard to be sure when it originally happened, but I'm certain it was hiking down some mountain path with 30 pounds of gear in my pack. As of today I am officially immobilized and in 6 weeks I look forward to hitting the trails again. In the meantime this baby cost me a trip to Africa. Damn!
