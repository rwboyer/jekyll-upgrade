I’ve been a bit spotty blogging lately, but lots has been happening on my side of the screen. Perhaps even too much. Managing a photography business isn’t easy in today’s world, especially with the high degree of travel that landscape/nature/travel photography entails. While I’m away things tend to pile up.

I guess the biggest thing to report is that due to the addition of a Hasselblad system, in addition to my Nikon system, I have had to make major changes to my workflow. The biggest news is that I am in the midst of converting from Aperture 3 to Lightroom 3 for my post-processing.

This comes as a shock to some of my followers, since I’ve been an Aperture advocate for years. It’s an exemplary post-processing program and has served me well. Hasselblad has its own processing system, called Phocus, and it is a good program for certain tasks. It interprets the Hassy raw files particularly well, much as NX2 does for Nikon’s raw files. But Lightroom is more sophisticated and handles a broad range of post-processing tasks. My associate, Bob Boyer, and I have tested Lightroom 3 and find it handles the Hassy and Nikon files excellently.

Aperture distinguishes itself in its organizational abilities. Frankly, I have never used its highly sophisticated organization to its fullest. Lightroom 3 seems to follow my workflow a bit more organically. So far I like it.

Frankly, I don’t do a whole lot of post-processing work. I intentionally shoot with the most neutral settings possible, as I do not want the camera to make decisions for me. That usually means that I have to tweak saturation, contrast and, of course, add sharpening, depending on my output. I always seem to have dust on my sensor or water vapor on my lens, so I all too often have to clear them up. I might crop here or there, but that’s about it. I have never bothered to learn PhotoShop, so I can’t even envision all the manipulations I could do to an image.

Unfortunately, the switch to Lightroom also entails a change in my backup routine, and Bob and I are in the midst of that process right now. As always, I’ll keep you posted on my post-processing software changes. In the meantime, if any of you have had experience changing from Aperture to Lightroom, I appreciate you sharing your story with us.

Thanks and happy shooting!
