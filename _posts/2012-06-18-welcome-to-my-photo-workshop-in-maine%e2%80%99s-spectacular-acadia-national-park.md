By now I hope you are all in the throes of summer, enjoying the warm weather and capturing lots of ‘keeper’ outdoor images. Of course, no passionate landscape/wildlife photographer ever gets enough time outdoors or enough keepers to feel fully satisfied. It’s like eating a great meal. At the end you feel wonderful, but in a few hours you’re hungry again.

As you go through your summer routine, why not take notes on areas of your photography that you’d like to improve? Do you have trouble interpreting light well enough to nail perfect exposures? Do your compositions lack punch? Are your images ‘soft’ looking?

I am a voracious digester of photographic information, so books and articles are my first stop when learning a new technique, keeping up with technological advances, or reading about the exploits of my colleagues. But at some point, I invariably find that I have to put those readings into practice by actually getting outdoors to try them. Sometimes I go out photographing with colleagues and marvel at the way they choose to interpret a scene, what techniques they apply and the post-processing they do to render their unique creative vision.

That is why I so strongly recommend that amateurs immerse themselves in photo workshops from time to time, whether to learn new techniques, see new vistas led by a photographer guide, or share ideas and images with fellow enthusiasts. Photo workshops ideally should be a small group. They are a lot of fun, mixed with some terrific take-aways in terms of techniques and ideas.

I’m leading just such a workshop to Acadia National Park along Maine’s photogenic rocky and forested coast beginning October 18. Fall is a gorgeous time of year in Maine, with reds and yellows and browns painting vivid landscapes. This 4-day experience will be chock full of vistas-to-die-for (but of course I promise to keep things very safe). Photography along the Maine coast is entirely weather dependent, but I’ve chosen venues that we can access in rain, shine or fog. Speaking of fog, that is definitely one of my favorite times to photograph in Maine.

I lived in Maine for ten years and actually did part of my doctoral work in ecology in Acadia NP. I think I know some of the nicest photo locations there. Suffice it to say that we’ll be visiting the storied rocky coast, the park’s pristine forests, marshes and ponds, picturesque towns and even some lobster boats. We’ll be on the move from sunrise to sunset (Did you know that Acadia’s Cadillac Mountain is the first place to witness sunrise in the U.S.?).

While the workshop is offered through the Nikonians Academy, where I am a faculty member, it makes absolutely no difference what make camera you have, whether you use a point-and-shoot or a $50,000 super pro setup, or whether you are a beginner or advanced amateur. You are guaranteed to learn something, meet interesting fellow photographers and have a good time (did I mention lobster dinner??). The course is strictly limited to 10 photographers. Only five spots remain.

On one or two of the evenings we will get a chance for a voluntary critique of our work (mine included). No one is coerced into offering their images up for group sacrifice. It’s all very informal and friendly and I’ve never had anyone say they did not benefit from even passively observing. I know I always get a lot out of these sessions (alternately, you could choose to skip it entirely and get an extra hour of shuteye!).
