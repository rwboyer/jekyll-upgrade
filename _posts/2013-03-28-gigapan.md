Yesterday I received a <a href="http://www.gigapan.com">GigaPan Epic Pro</a> and I'm already impressed. I haven't really used it yet - just a dumb indoor pano as a sort of 'proof of concept' for my own edification.

Over the next few weeks, once I've had a chance to look through the manual and get the apparatus up and running, I'll report back to you on my impressions of this machine.

For those of you who do not know about the GigaPan technology, it is an award winning (Editor's Choice Award from Popular Photography and American Photo) computerized robot to which you anchor your camera/lens, show it what panoramic photo you want to take, press a few buttons and PRESTO, in minutes you have a gigantonormous image with, say 10, 20, 50, even 500 Gigabytes of information in it!! No, that's not a misprint. People have actually composed pano images with the GigaPan using a Hasselbald 50 MP camera and taking 500 images. Think of how many gigabyte files THAT produces!

The GigaPan is a commercial spin-off of the technology from Carnegie-Mellon University that is currently being used on the Mars Rover missions. As you can see from the photo, you mount it on your tripod , program its functions and let it rip away. Videos on the GigaPan site show you how it's done. What attracted us is that the resulting images have such a high level of detail it should satisfy our clients' needs for ultra-large images. Last year, for example, we <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/commercial-installations/">produced a pano image</a> that covered 30-feet by 9-feet. We did it without a GigaPan, but had we used the GigaPan it would have made the job easier and given us evenmore detail.

So, I can't wait to jump in and give this baby a whirl! Stay tuned.
