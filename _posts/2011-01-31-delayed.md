I decided to leave for the airport the night before my flight to Yukon, due to our local weather forecast here in Baltimore calling for ice and snow tomorrow morning. I figured if I avoided the icy roads going down to the airport in the morning, I might have a chance of making my flight.

No such luck! As soon as I checked into the hotel (of course it couldn't have happened ten minutes earlier) I got a text message that my flight had been cancelled. Don't they de-ice planes anymore?

So now I'm spending the night at a b-o-r-i-n-g hotel, one of those new brands that Starwood patched together to meet the needs of stranded passengers. It's sort of an attempt at a Euro look. Not much in the way of furnishings, yet clean and very efficient. To be honest, when I'm stranded like this I'm really not looking for more. Just a comfy bed and a quiet place to read and write and listen to music.

The dark side of my delay is that I'll get to spend another wonderful night in a hotel tomorrow night, this time in Vancouver, since the delay will also force me to miss my connection to Whitehorse, Yukon. That means a day less photography with my friend, a fantastic Yukon-based photographer named <a href="http://www.hartmier.com">Richard Hartmier</a>. If you haven't yet seen his work, go to his website and enjoy (and ORDER HIS BOOK). His Northern Lights images are superb.

Okay, back to cleaning my lenses. Stay warm.

<strong>PS: I awoke this morning to clear skies and not even a hint of precipitation. Damn!!</strong>
