Before I left for Yellowstone a couple of weeks ago, I was anxious about only one photographic issue. How would my Hasselblad H4D batteries perform in the cold weather?

<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/imgres-1.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2555" title="imgres-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/imgres-1-300x165.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="165"></a>

Of course Hasselblad is a superb camera system, second to none and I love its luscious, film-like images and incredible dynamic range. Those of you who follow my blog know that I shoot Nikon and Hasselblad. But ever since I started using Hassy, I have been disappointed in its battery capacity. My Nikon D200, D300, D700 and now the D800 keep going and going, like the Energizer bunny. I can get 1,000 clicks and more from a single charge. But with my Hassy, if I got 100 shots outdoors I considered myself fortunate. So I was apprehensive prior to leaving for the north.

Then, one day while researchiong the issue of the Internet, I found a post by "HLArt" on the Hasselblad Digital Forum. I followed his advice and I haven't had a problem in normal temps ever since. But Yellowstone in winter was far different!

Well, I am happy to report that my Hassy batteries lasted either all day or close to it, and that was at temps that fluctuated between -13F to +25 (mostly below zero). For those of you who follow such things or are frustrated by your Hassy batteries, may I recommend HLArt's procedure, which I quote here in its entirety.

"So here's how to reset an H battery if it is not holding a charge or not lasting as long as it should.
First charge the battery fully, preferably overnight.
Then grab an H body with no battery on it and press and hold the "menu" and "flash" buttons, and while holding them down push the battery up onto the handgrip. You should then here a rapid series of beeps indicating the PMU on the battery has been reset. Now put the battery back on charge and it should improve performance.

On a side note new batteries will have a low initial capacity, cycle them through charge discharge (on the camera) a few times to get full capacity."

Many thanks to HLArt from me and any Hassy users who may benefit from my reposting his advice. It sure worked for me!
