It’s now official. After months of planning, I will be offering a photography workshop for the Nikonians Academy in the Yukon, a place I love dearly. The course will run from August 27<sup>th</sup> to September 4<sup>th</sup>, the absolutely most spectacular time of the year to be in Canada’s famed Yukon Territory.

Late August is the drop-dead gorgeous Fall season in Yukon. We will begin our journey in Whitehorse, where the Yukon’s only international airport is located. After an orientation session we drive by commercial vans to Dawson City, site of the famous Klondike Gold Rush. This historic town is a photographer’s dream, with gravel streets, wood sidewalks and historical structures in various states of repair. The indigenous First Nations culture is alive and well here, too.

While in the Dawson region, we will have numerous opportunities to photograph the Northern Lights, an amazing spectacle that everyone must see sometime in their life. While in Dawson we will travel the scenic Top of the World Highway to Alaska, photographing the landscape and an abandoned gold mine town.

Next we travel up the storied Dempster Highway to the Arctic Circle, where we should have many opportunities to photograph grizzly bears, moose, foxes, beavers, caribou, eagles and other wildlife. The scenery changes markedly from forest to tundra as we head north to the Arctic Circle. Most incredible is the change of color as Fall transforms the tundra into flaming reds, oranges and earth-tones. There is nothing else like it, a place few people get to visit, let alone photograph with two professional guides. Since we are so far north, daylight lasts until 11 PM. What more can a photographer ask for?

I say two guides because I will be accompanied by my co-instructor Richard Hartmier (<a href="http://www.hartmier.com">www.hartmier.com</a>) a Yukon resident and photographer par excellence. Richard is a storehouse of knowledge about the Yukon environment, knows hidden photography spots that a casual visitor would never discover, and is an excellent instructor.

As we retrace our steps to get back to Whitehorse, the Fall landscapes will have changed dramatically and we’ll stop and shoot our way back during sunrises, sunsets and nighttime Aurora excursions.

When you first arrive in Whitehorse, you will not have ot take out your wallet again (except for alcoholic beverages). All food, transportation, even sunscreen and insect repellant, are included. We want you to focus exclusively on photography.

Nikonians workshops are for all levels of photographic skills. Here you’ll have a chance to learn new techniques, refine existing techniques, or just plain snap some images on your point-and-shoot. The workshop is limited to 14 people, so everyone has plenty of instructional time, as needed. Nikonians workshops are fun, with lots of information sharing throughout.
